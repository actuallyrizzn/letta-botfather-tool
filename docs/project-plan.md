# 🛠️ Project Plan: Telegram BotFather Provisioning System (Finalized)

## Overview
A two-part system for provisioning Telegram bots via BotFather, with a local relay and a tool function/CLI for integration and testing. All deliverables are implemented, tested, and documented.

## Deliverables
- **botfather_relay/**: FastAPI relay and Telethon client
- **botfather.py**: Tool function and CLI
- **tests/**: All test scripts (run with pytest)
- **README.md**: Usage, integration, troubleshooting, and licensing
- **LICENSE**: CC-BY-SA 4.0

## Usage Examples
### Python Function
```python
from botfather import provision_botfather_message
replies = provision_botfather_message("/newbot")
for reply in replies:
    print(reply)
```

### CLI
```bash
python botfather.py "/newbot"
```

### Expected Response
```json
{
  "messages": ["BotFather reply 1", "BotFather reply 2"]
}
```
On error:

{
  "error": "Description of the error"
}
```

- Handle exceptions for network or relay errors.
- See README for troubleshooting and test instructions.

## Testing
